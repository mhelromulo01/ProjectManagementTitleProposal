Hopping on the track or treadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise can reduce anxiety sensitivity. And we thought intervals were just a good way to burn calories said Breene 2013. According to Mayo Clinic Staff 2016, regular exercise helps prevent or manage a wide range of health problems and concerns, including stroke, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and depression.

A full-body workout regimen for beginners includes the chest press, shoulder press, back rows, leg press, leg extensions, leg curls and crunches. Beginners perform one set of eight to 12 reps of each exercise. Take your time and use a light weight until you are comfortable with the technique of each exercise. Once you’ve mastered the techniques, use a weight that will make completing eight to 12 reps challenging said Nunley 2015. According to Samuels 2013, you need a minimum of three days and a maximum of six days in a week. Dedicate three weekly sessions to weight training.

One reason why we workout is to burn calories, according to Corleone 2015, Most people who exercise regularly can lose weight by limiting their intake to 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day. Fanslau 2016, the better your body composition that is, more muscle and bone, and less fat the leaner you will ultimately be. Muscle increases your resting metabolic rate and burning a higher amount of calories. Muscular strength is connected with lower risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. 
Protein is important for muscle building, but eating more than you need is not going to make you leaner or help you lose weight. To keep calories under control and meet your protein needs, include lean sources such as poultry, seafood, lean red meat, beans or tofu in your weight-loss diet. Low-fat and nonfat dairy foods are also a good source of protein as well as carbs. A glass of low-fat chocolate milk or a cup of nonfat yogurt makes a good snack choice after you exercise, as it helps refuel and promote muscle recovery said Corleone 2015.

Mobile technology offers a possible alternative to tackle this problem.

Context awareness features enabled through sensing and phone-based personal information. Mobile technology provides an opportunity to develop interventions with lower costs, less burden, and a greater reach to extend key components of intensive weight loss treatment into real-world settings. Mobile technology could provide another tool in the armamentarium of healthcare professionals in tackling the barriers to physical activity and promoting healthier lifestyles. (Padmasekara 2014)
