  There are some reasons why people don’t do workouts. One of the reasons is a busy schedule. It can be hard to find time to work out. Another reason is you have tried exercise but you keep quitting, because doing too much too soon at the gym is bound to leave you exhausted and burned out. Another reason is confusion; because beginners are not sure how to get started you may choose random exercises, wondering if you're even getting a decent workout. Soreness is another factor for a beginner but you should be able to function. Some beginners can’t endure their soreness and decide not to continue their workout. Another factor is being impatient to see the changes that they want to attain in their body. It takes 12 weeks to see major changes but if the beginners didn’t see any changes in the first week they lose their motivation. 
  
Benefits of workout are to help you sleep better fall and stay asleep more easily, and it increases the amount of time you spend in the deepest stage of sleep. Working out also improves skin and muscle tone, increases flexibility and reduces the risk of many age-related diseases, such as osteoporosis, heart disease and stroke. Workout also improves self-confidence by gaining muscle tone, strength, stamina, and you'll feel better emotionally. It also reduces stress and anxiety by diminishing electrical activity in tense muscles as soon as you finish your workout, which makes you less hyperactive and jittery. Another benefit of workout is that it provides you with the motivation to improve your diet, and proper nutrition reduces stress. There is even evidence that regular exercise can aid in treating clinical depression. The best reason of all to work out regularly is that it reduces your risk of many serious and potentially deadly diseases, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, colon cancer and breast cancer.

Review Related Literature

Brooke Blue 2015, when it comes to working out, most people fall into one of two categories, some love to mix it up while the others are creatures of habit. Studies support the fact that workouts that challenge your body in new ways over time are the most beneficial. According to Sulaver 2013, there are reasons to start working at the gym. First, you will feel awesome after you exercise because it increases feel-good hormones and the study suggested that high intensity exercise modulates the brain in a very similar way to cocaine use. Being stronger, leaner, happier, and more capable can make for a more manageable and easier life.

Working up a sweat can help manage physical and mental stress.  It can increase concentrations of norepinephrine that can moderate the brains response to stress. Physical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive self-image. The warm and fuzzy chemicals that are released during and after exercise can help people with anxiety disorders calm down. Hopping on the track or treadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise can reduce anxiety sensitivity. And we thought intervals were just a good way to burn calories said Breene 2013. According to Mayo Clinic Staff 2016, regular exercise helps prevent or manage a wide range of health problems and concerns, including stroke, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and depression.

A full-body workout regimen for beginners includes the chest press, shoulder press, back rows, leg press, leg extensions, leg curls and crunches. Beginners perform one set of eight to 12 reps of each exercise. Take your time and use a light weight until you are comfortable with the technique of each exercise. Once you’ve mastered the techniques, use a weight that will make completing eight to 12 reps challenging said Nunley 2015. According to Samuels 2013, you need a minimum of three days and a maximum of six days in a week. Dedicate three weekly sessions to weight training. Make these total-body workouts, in which you work every major muscle group in a single session.

One reason why we workout is to burn calories, according to Corleone 2015, Most people who exercise regularly can lose weight by limiting their intake to 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day. Fanslau 2016, the better your body composition that is, more muscle and bone, and less fat the leaner you will ultimately be. Muscle increases your resting metabolic rate and burning a higher amount of calories. Muscular strength is connected with lower risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. 
Protein is important for muscle building, but eating more than you need is not going to make you leaner or help you lose weight. To keep calories under control and meet your protein needs, include lean sources such as poultry, seafood, lean red meat, beans or tofu in your weight-loss diet. Low-fat and nonfat dairy foods are also a good source of protein as well as carbs. A glass of low-fat chocolate milk or a cup of nonfat yogurt makes a good snack choice after you exercise, as it helps refuel and promote muscle recovery said Corleone 2015.

Mobile technology offers a possible alternative to tackle this problem. In the last three years, overall smartphone usage among Filipinos in the Philippines more than doubled according to a report from statistics portal Statista. Currently, about 30 percent of all Filipinos are smartphone users and that is projected to increase said Medellina 2016. Mobile phones are attractive avenue for delivering health interventions because of the widespread adoption of phones with increasingly powerful technical capabilities, people’s tendency to carry their phones with them everywhere. Context awareness features enabled through sensing and phone-based personal information. Mobile technology provides an opportunity to develop interventions with lower costs, less burden, and a greater reach to extend key components of intensive weight loss treatment into real-world settings. Mobile technology could provide another tool in the armamentarium of healthcare professionals in tackling the barriers to physical activity and promoting healthier lifestyles. (Padmasekara 2014)
